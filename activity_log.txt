Tried following instructions at:

https://superset.apache.org/docs/installation/installing-superset-using-docker-compose/

...didn't work

Moved on to instructions at:

https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/superset

...more success, was able to login

Stopped container. Realised need to connect to real SQL database to import custom data.

...they worked!
