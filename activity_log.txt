#1

Tried following instructions at:

https://superset.apache.org/docs/installation/installing-superset-using-docker-compose/

...didn't work

Moved on to instructions at:

https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/superset

...more success, was able to login

Stopped container. Realised need to connect to real SQL database to import custom data.


#2

Installed Postgres DB to host.

Began building Dockerfile with hopes of connecting to Postgres DB on host.

Used the dependency list at:

https://superset.apache.org/docs/databases/installing-database-drivers

Found guides for opening up Postgres to new connections:

^ at bottom of page

...they worked!



#3

Began setting up Postgres DB.

https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-postgresql-on-ubuntu-20-04-quickstart

Checked v14 is actually officially supported (phew, it is)

https://superset.apache.org/docs/installation/configuring-superset

t $  sudo -i -u postgres 

postgres $  createuser --interactive

postgres $  createdb test_db

# useradd test_db

Opting to share network with host to keep localhost connections simple, connect localhost:8088.

So to build and run:

$ cd ~/superset_experiment.git/

$ docker build .

$ docker run -d  --network=host --name superset 405bd7434a1e
